    "Ans: global scope we have only one, it means we should initialise a variable outside a function, then it will work throughout the program. Local scopes can be many like, if you have 3 functions and 2 classes, then you will have those many local scopes, basically local scope is something you have intiialised the vairbale inside a function or a class, and if you want some variable to be glonbal even though you initialise inside a function or a class then you can mention it as global Eg: global a\n",
